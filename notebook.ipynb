Data Cleaning\n","\n","<p>Over the past few years, streaming services with huge catalogs have become the primary means through which most people listen to their favorite music. But at the same time, the sheer amount of music on offer can mean users might be a bit overwhelmed when trying to look for newer music that suits their tastes.</p>\n","<p>For this reason, streaming services have looked into means of categorizing music to allow for personalized recommendations. One method involves direct analysis of the raw audio information in a given song, scoring the raw data on a variety of metrics. Today, we'll be examining data compiled by a research group known as The Echo Nest. Our goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single one ourselves.</p>\n","<p>We will use metadata about our tracks alongside data from The Echo Nest. A song is about more than its title, artist, and number of listens. We have another dataset that has musical features of each track such as <code>danceability</code> and <code>acousticness</code> on a scale from -1 to 1. These exist in two different files, which are in different formats - CSV and JSON.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","Int64Index: 4802 entries, 0 to 4801\n","Data columns (total 10 columns):\n"," #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------            --------------  -----  \n"," 0   track_id          4802 non-null   int64  \n"," 1   acousticness      4802 non-null   float64\n"," 2   danceability      4802 non-null   float64\n"," 3   energy            4802 non-null   float64\n"," 4   instrumentalness  4802 non-null   float64\n"," 5   liveness          4802 non-null   float64\n"," 6   speechiness       4802 non-null   float64\n"," 7   tempo             4802 non-null   float64\n"," 8   valence           4802 non-null   float64\n"," 9   genre_top         4802 non-null   object \n","dtypes: float64(8), int64(1), object(1)\n","memory usage: 412.7+ KB\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Read in track metadata with genre labels\n","tracks = pd.read_csv('datasets/fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv')\n","\n","# Read in track metrics with the features\n","echonest_metrics = pd.read_json('datasets/echonest-metrics.json', precise_float=True)\n","\n","# Merge the relevant columns of tracks and echonest_metrics\n","echo_tracks = echonest_metrics.merge(tracks[['track_id', 'genre_top']], on='track_id', how='inner')\n","\n","# Inspect the resultant dataframe\n","echo_tracks.info()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"10"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 2.
